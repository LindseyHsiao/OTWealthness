        title: 'BENEFITS OF JOURNALING', 
        content: `Thank you for checking out my newly released website, I am so excited to begin this journey with you! I have been writing in diaries and journals since I was 12 years old, without realizing that it was therapeutically helping me by allowing me to release and express my emotions. I want to share with you raw content from one of my personal journals, from two years ago, at a time when I was in a different headspace. Before Odaly Tineo Wealthness would become an existing business and a starting brand there was no dream, no inspiration I could see or even manifest. I was filled with insecurities and uncertainties, some of which I have surpassed. For this month’s blog topic, I will be discussing the perseverance of pushing through the ugly emotions of self-doubt and self-loathing, and how journaling can help you through it all. 

        The journal entry I am sharing with you this month (down below) was written in November of 2019, a year of great change for me, however I did not always feel great. I had decided to part ways with corporate America at the start of the year, and I ventured into the days and months of 2019 moving through uncomfortable feelings and situations. By deep breaths and journaling through my depression I pushed forward, and it also helped show me full bliss. It was the most present I had ever lived my life. 
        
        “Today is one of those days where I am feeling shitty with myself. If you go on social media all you see is who is doing what and or making what, and let’s not leave behind the motivational quotes that for the most part I love, but a day like today I hate them. I am not motivated, disciplined, or happy about facing the day, so NOT, today! I could care less about all of them and even my own motivational thoughts or sayings. As I scan through Instagram a common post kept coming up people posted a quote from Nipsey Hussle, “Find your purpose or you are wasting air” that fucking hurt my heart on a day like today and it makes me think about people who kill themselves, because of many reasons like not feeling worthy or being lost without a sense of living, an unfulfilled life. That quote can drive you to start planning a suicide on a day like today. The saddest part in all this, is that God, the Divine Source living within me has gifted me with so much all of my life! The more I look back I think to myself, wow I am blessed!  At this moment I basically have been supported and am surviving a year without working. I been able to travel to so many places and spent an extended amount of precious time with family and friends. I am doing whatever I want for the most part. This year has also been hard, frustrating, confusing, and if I could use one word or two to describe it, it would be struggling and perseverance. I started a business with two of my friends, who are on their own journey and all for the love of yoga we called the business, Trilogy Yoga Retreats, we put a retreat together to Colombia. No one came, not even one person outside of us three, yet we still went through with the trip, and it was beyond what we could imagine. We literally started hustling yoga in the streets of Bogota’s town center teaching breath and yoga movements in Spanish and English, we made connections everywhere we went and it was heartfelt. I mean who doesn't have a great time exploring the world, learning new things, eating new things, and making new friends all over the world. I got to experience different parts of beautiful Colombia landscapes. There is so much more there to explore! I wanted to write because it is what makes me feel better on days like this one. God, I know you are disappointed with me, but I know you love me unconditionally, I know You do, but I feel You looking down at me and thinking “Odaly all these gifts I have given you and here you are crying feeling like a waste of air, because you have no job, no career, no drive to do anything, stuck in this little bubble that you choose for yourself.” I say I love yoga and yet I am not disciplined enough to keep moving forward with teaching, offering private classes, and putting together classes although that is what makes me feel most alive. I am a procrastinator at her best! I think about the book I read last month, The Alchemist, and how I quoted something that still rings in my heart about the search of our purpose and for me, to be in the search is to be in the know, the awareness, of that search which is a great place to be. Perhaps I don't  know what my purpose or I do and I just don’t know where to start in this point of my life, but there are moments in life that I know we're purposeful. Everything that has happened to me, to us has led us into the space we are currently in and to give up or stop searching would be a waste of air! Ok girl, so poetic! God reminds us to always give thanks and praise, today is one of those hard days to find the things or people I have to be thankful for, not because there isn't anything to be thankful for, but because this day is hard mentally for me to be thankful for anything other than what my little brain thinks needs to be happening. The read devotional today tells me “Peace be with you,” and that is how I want to end this entry.”
        
        Writing brings clarity and that almost always brings you into gratitude in the present moment. The ripple effect is peace of mind and joy. I encourage everyone to journal, especially my clients, it is a great tool to clear your mind and save your life. Now, I am sharing my saving grace with you, in hopes to inspire you to push forward on your personal journey.

               TIPS ON JOURNALING 
        
         Use handwritten journals or software that you are familiar with. 
         Write daily (maybe set a reminder). It is also a great way to pause your day and check in with how you are feeling and how your day is going. 
         Don’t worry about spelling or punctuation, just write! 
         Don’t be afraid to express the dark thoughts that you may never share with anyone else. This is for you. 
         Writing can help you uncover many creative sides to your purpose, have fun with it! `,
